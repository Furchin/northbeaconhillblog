This blog aims to serve the neighborhood of North Beacon Hill, a Seattle neighborhood bounded by I-5 to the West, Jefferson Park to the South, Rainier Ave S to the East, and I-90 to the North.

# Content Policy
We aim to provide unbiased information pertinent to Beacon Hill, with a particular focus on North Beacon Hill. We will *not* feature information of broader interest: for example, new Seattle city policies will not be included unless they pertain uniquely to Beacon Hill in some way.
