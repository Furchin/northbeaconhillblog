The Seattle Department of Transportation wants your input! SDOT is running a study on access to the [Beacon Hill Light Rail station and mobility](https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/transportation-planning/beacon-hill-station-access-and-mobility-study). They recently posted [this survey](http://seattlecitygis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=0e008d3d789c43ffb5a204d64e7ffda6) which allows you to draw specific improvements on a map.
