I'm saddened to see that the [Beacon Hill Blog](http://beaconhill.seattle.wa.us) hasn't had a post in 3 years, ever since Wendi moved away. While a lot of information can be found on [the mailing list](http://beaconhill.seattle.wa.us/mailing-lists/) or the [Beacon Hill, Seattle](https://www.facebook.com/groups/beaconhillseattle/) and the [Beacon Hill Social Club](https://www.facebook.com/groups/beaconhillsocialclub) Facebook groups, the neighborhood is missing a source for news without all of the editorialization, advertisements, items for sale, and requests for plumbers. Hopefully this blog can serve to fill that niche. Welcome!
